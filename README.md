# mplstyle
A collection of customized matplotlib styles sheets. 

For my own usage, but  might be of interest of someone else.

## Usage
At the begining of your `python`üêç script add the following lines:

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

`path = '~/Documents/FolderWhereYourStyleSheetIsLocated/`

`plt.style.use(path + 'timesnromanstyle.mplstyle')'`

That's all.

## Example
See `usage_example.py` file for a minimal example.
